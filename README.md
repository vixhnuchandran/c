# Basics of C Programming

This repository contains a collection of simple C programming examples that cover fundamental concepts of the C language. Each file demonstrates a specific topic, making it a valuable resource for beginners looking to learn and practice C programming.

## Overview

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development. This collection aims to introduce the core concepts of C programming in a straightforward manner.

## File List

1. **0.HelloWorld.c**: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This file introduces the basic structure of a C program.

2. **1.Variables.c**: Demonstrates how to declare and initialize variables of different data types, including integers, floats, and characters.

3. **2.DataTypes.c**: Explains the various data types available in C, such as `int`, `float`, `char`, and their characteristics.

4. **3.FormatSpecifiers.c**: Shows how to use format specifiers in `printf` and `scanf` for displaying and taking input of different data types.

5. **4.Constants.c**: Introduces constants in C, including how to define and use constant values in programs.

6. **5.ArithmeticOperators.c**: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) for performing basic mathematical calculations.

7. **6.UserInput.c**: Shows how to read user input using `scanf`, along with basic input validation.

8. **7.MathFunctions.c**: An introduction to standard math functions provided by the `math.h` library for performing advanced mathematical operations.

9. **8.IfStatements.c**: Explains conditional statements using `if`, `else if`, and `else` to control the flow of execution.

10. **9.SwitchStatements.c**: Demonstrates the use of the `switch` statement for multi-way branching based on variable values.

11. **10.LogicalOperators.c**: Introduces logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) and their use in forming complex conditions.

12. **11.Functions.c**: Covers the concept of functions in C, including function declaration, definition, and how to call them.

13. **12.Arguments.c**: Demonstrates how to pass arguments to functions and use them within the function body.

14. **13.Return.c**: Explains the use of `return` statements in functions and how to return values from them.

15. **14.TernaryOperator.c**: Introduces the ternary conditional operator for simplifying conditional expressions.

16. **15.FunctionPrototype.c**: Covers the use of function prototypes to declare functions before they are defined.

17. **16.StringFunctions.c**: Demonstrates basic string operations using functions from the `string.h` library, including string length and concatenation.

18. **17.ForLoops.c**: An introduction to `for` loops, covering their syntax and how to use them for iterating over a range of values.

19. **18.WhileLoops.c**: Explains `while` loops and their use for repeated execution based on a condition.

20. **19.DoWhileLoops.c**: Introduces `do while` loops and how they ensure at least one execution of the loop body.

21. **20.NestedLoops.c**: Demonstrates nested loops and their applications in multi-dimensional data processing.

22. **21.ControlFlowKeywords.c**: Covers various control flow keywords in C, including `break`, `continue`, and `goto`, explaining their purposes and use cases.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the examples, you'll need a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your machine. You can compile an example with the following command:

```bash
gcc <filename.c> -o <output_executable>
```
